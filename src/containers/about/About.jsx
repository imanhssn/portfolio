                    I'm a developer based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, currently employed at Hong Leong MSIG Takaful. I've enjoyed web design and programming ever since I was a tween and learned HTML to personalise my own Myspace profile. I'm a Google Certified UX Designer and proficient in several languanges such as C++, Javascript, HTML and CSS.
